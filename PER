# JigStack Mobile UI Performance Report (MVP)

This report is a *procedure + checklist* for validating mobile UI performance without changing game logic.

## Target Device Simulation
- Use Chrome devtools:
  - Performance tab CPU throttling (4× or 6×)
  - Network throttling (Fast 3G optional)
  - Rendering: emulate 30fps by watching frame times in Performance capture

## What To Measure
### 1) Frame time spikes
- Watch for frames > 33ms (30fps budget)
- Watch for bursts of frames > 50ms

### 2) Layout / style thrash
- Ensure HUD updates do not trigger large layout recalcs
- CSS uses transforms/opacity where possible

### 3) Input responsiveness
- Tap zones should feel instant
- No double-input
- Soft-drop must always release
## Known Risk Areas
- DOM-heavy updates per tick
- Unbounded event listeners
- Scroll/rubber-banding causing repaint

## Current Mitigations
- Mobile mode hides heavy panels (leaderboard, how-to)
- Gesture layer prevents camera gesture overhead
- Inputs debounced centrally

#TODO (If Perf Issues Found)
- Cap update frequency for non-critical UI elements (e.g. intensity bar) to 10hz
- Use requestAnimationFrame batching for DOM writes
- Avoid textContent updates if value unchanged
